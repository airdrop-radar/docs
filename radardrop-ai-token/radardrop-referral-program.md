# RadarDrop Referral program

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Our referral program is fully on-chain and aims to reward those helping spreading the word about our platform and bringing new customers to use RadarDrop. We've designed a program to benefit people referring our platform.&#x20;

You'll be able to modify your referral links and customize them as you wish.

Tracked and fully on-chain referral

We've thought of a tier system to reward those users who are most active on RadarDrop and who share their referral link the most. The more you spread the word, the more you earn!
