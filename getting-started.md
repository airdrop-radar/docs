## Our ultimate feature: Replication

Once you've got all the information you need about the airdrop farm, you can choose to use our ultimate feature: replication. This will enable you to reproduce the recommended on-chain farming actions with a single click.

On the first modal you can choose additional options such as top-up of your wallet with tokens used to pay gas fees on the blockchain testnet.

Once you've chosen your options, simply click on “Start replication”. A Metamask window should pop, asking you to approve the amount of $RADAI to be spent (no amount other than that calculated by us will be accepted).

Finally, a second Metamask window should open, asking you to approve the final transaction.

Once the transaction has been approved, we generate a private key associated with the wallet, which will perform the on-chain farming actions for you.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">**PLEASE SAVE THIS PRIVATE KEY AT ALL COSTS, AS WE DO NOT STORE IT**</mark>_. _<mark style="color:red;">**IF YOU LOSE IT, YOU ALSO RISK LOSING THE BENEFITS OF REPLICATION AND YOUR POSSIBLE BAG OF TOKENS IF YOU'RE AIRDROPPED**</mark>_.

Once you've saved your private key, simply click on “Start replication” and farming will start for you.
