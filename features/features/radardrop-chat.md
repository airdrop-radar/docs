# RadarDrop Chat

### RadarDrop AI

RadarDrop AI will give you all the information you need about airdrop farming.\
You'll get access to all the instructions to farm any ongoing airdrop and be sure to qualify for it!

For example, you can ask whether an airdrop is confirmed or not. If so, when is the token distribution scheduled? He'll give you the most precise answer possible.

### RadarDrop Chat channel system

RadarDrop Chat works with a channel system. You can create a channel to chat with RadarDrop AI in two ways either by:

* clicking directly on "Farm" on an airdrop card in the [Airdrop Finder](airdrop-finder.md) (which will create a **channel specific for the airdrop**)&#x20;
* or by clicking on '+' (which will create a **general channel**).

To delete a channel, simply click on the three small dots to the right of the top bar.

Every time you open a RadarDrop Chat window, the top bar shows the project name, its badge (Potential/Claimable), and all the links our web scraper has collected on the web. Most often available: the project's Twitter account, website and whitepaper/doc. Finally, there's a button to mark this airdrop as farmed and the [Replication](replication.md) button if it's replicable.

### LLM tokens

As soon as you create an account on RadarDrop we offer you **15 free chat messages** and **1 free replication**. A small button at the bottom right of the chat shows you how many messages you have left.&#x20;

Once you've used up all your chat messages, you can buy more by clicking on this button.

If the airdrop is replicable, you'll see the "Replicate" button on the top, meaning you can use RadarDrop's [Replication](replication.md) for this airdrop.
