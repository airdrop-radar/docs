# Replication

## Automated farming

Tired of farming airdrops manually? \
Select an airdrop and let us do it for you by reproducing the required on-chain farming actions, maximizing your chances of qualifying for this airdrop!

Once RadarDrop Chat gave you all the information you need about the airdrop farm, you can choose to use our ultimate feature: _**Replication**_. This will enable you to reproduce the recommended on-chain farming actions with a single click.

### Subscribe to a plan

To take full advantage of RadarDrop's services, you'll need to purchase a plan using our cryptocurrency $RDAI. If you run out of available replications, you'll see this first modal appear, prompting you to choose from one of the three available plans.

### Choose your option(s)

Once you've chosen a plan, you can choose additional options such as top-up of your wallet with tokens used to pay gas fees on the blockchain testnet.

### $RDAI payment with your wallet

Once you've chosen your options, simply click on “Start replication”. A Metamask window should pop, asking you to approve the amount of $RDAI to be spent (no amount other than that calculated by us will be accepted).

Finally, a second Metamask window should open, asking you to approve the final transaction.

### Burner wallet creation

Once the transaction has been confirmed, we generate a new wallet with its associated private key. This wallet  will perform the on-chain farming actions for you.&#x20;

### Replication: automation of on-chain farming actions

Once you've saved your private key, simply click on “Start replication” and farming will start for you.

Once the replication is complete, you'll see a summary of the web3 actions completed with the farming wallet address in the final modal.

_Farming points will be detailed in a later post._

You can then:

* &#x20;mark the current airdrop as farmed,&#x20;
* add it to your watchlist, &#x20;
* and start replication again.
