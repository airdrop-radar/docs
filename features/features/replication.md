# Replication

## Our ultimate feature: Replication

Tired of farming airdrops manually? \
Select an airdrop and let us do it for you by reproducing the required on-chain farming actions, maximizing your chances of qualifying for this airdrop!

Once you've got all the information you need about the airdrop farm, you can choose to use our ultimate feature: replication. This will enable you to reproduce the recommended on-chain farming actions with a single click.

On the first modal you can choose additional options such as top-up of your wallet with tokens used to pay gas fees on the blockchain testnet.

Once you've chosen your options, simply click on “Start replication”. A Metamask window should pop, asking you to approve the amount of $RDAI to be spent (no amount other than that calculated by us will be accepted).

Finally, a second Metamask window should open, asking you to approve the final transaction.

Once the transaction has been approved, we generate a private key associated with the wallet, which will perform the on-chain farming actions for you.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">**PLEASE SAVE THIS PRIVATE KEY AT ALL COSTS, AS WE DO NOT STORE IT**</mark>_. _<mark style="color:red;">**IF YOU LOSE IT, YOU ALSO RISK LOSING THE BENEFITS OF REPLICATION AND YOUR POSSIBLE BAG OF TOKENS IF YOU'RE AIRDROPPED**</mark>_.

Once you've saved your private key, simply click on “Start replication” and farming will start for you.
