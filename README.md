## Introduction

AidropRadar AI is the new ultimate tool for farm cryptocurrency airdrops built on algorithms that cross-reference data scrapped from different websites with data processed by the most powerful AIs available on the market today.

### The Motivation for Creating AirdropRadar AI

As big fans of technological innovation happening on blockchains, we regularly participate in the various test phases of new emerging blockchains on the market. We're airdrop hunters, and we've been hunting and farming airdrops for a while now, with no reliable tools that allow us to do so quickly and efficiently. Once we decided to build it, we threw ourselves into making the best product we could dream of!

### A Dedicated Team and a Shared Vision

We were fed up with missing airdrops, so we wanted a platform where all airdrop hunters could farm in one place, efficiently. We're dedicated to the long term, designing features for the imminent phases and some for a little later, to ensure the success of the community and the project.
