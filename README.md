## Introduction

RadarDrop is the new ultimate platform for cryptocurrency airdrops farming built on algorithms that cross-reference data scrapped from different websites with data processed by the most powerful AI models available on the market today.

### The Motivation for Creating RadarDrop

As big fans of technological innovation happening on blockchains, we regularly participate in the various test phases of new emerging projects/blockchains on the market. We're airdrop hunters, and we've been farming airdrops for a while now, with no reliable tools that allow us to do so quickly and efficiently. Once we decided to build it, we threw ourselves into making the best product we could dream of!

### A Dedicated Team and a Shared Vision

We were fed up with missing airdrops, so we wanted a platform where all airdrop hunters could farm in one place, efficiently. We are dedicated to the long term, designing features for imminent phases and others for later, as indicated in our roadmap, to ensure the success of the project.
